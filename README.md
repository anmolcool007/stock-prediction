Twitter Sentiment Analysis to improve Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
## Description

Stock market prediction has always been a challenge in our society, every year computational analysts and data scientists try to understand this huge volatile chunk with millions of data using their techniques and models to predict a trend which work only under certain factors with limited accuracy. The result becomes interesting when you take many factors into account while trying to get sensible results over plethora of related data from unrelated fields.

## Introduction

In this project we attempt to predict the behaviour of the stock market by using time-series data while incorporating other environmental factors in the neural network architecture - Long Short Term Memory(LSTM). These environmental factors are not mentioned in previous stock data, they just affect the result eg: disease outbreak , change of government etc. understanding these factors and their effect on the stock prices can improve the stock estimation drastically. We aim to vary the weights of our network by these data and see how it matches with the previous result.
